Designed a hand-held electroretinography (ERG) device connected with smartphone integrated with Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science to analyze retinal responses for early detection of psychological stress. The device records electrical activity in the retina, which is then processed using ML algorithms to identify patterns linked to emotional and cognitive states. By analyzing these patterns, the system can predict and identify psychological conditions, helping to intervene before students engage in potentially dangerous actions.
